# odin-rps-game

My first JavaScript project!

Rock, Paper, Scissors app for ODIN PROJECT

Goal: Design a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game to play against the CPU in the browser console.

Notes:  I got sidetracked and went a little overboard and designed a GUI to play the game from the page using buttons for user inputs in place of using prompt() as specified.
